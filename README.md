Dragon Scipts

Use the EnglishDragon.cs scripts to atack and EnglishCreatedragon.cs to create the dragon 
Administrator team creates a dragon with a certain amount of health (it is set through the parameters of the script). Further, the chatters by another team can "beat" this dragon, causing damage, depending on their rank (rank of the chatter + 1). With a certain probability (10% each), the dragon can be dealt critical damage, the dragon can be missed, the dragon can block and throw the striker into the mutes (for 30 seconds, can be removed by commenting out the line in the script), can dodge and restore 5 health. When the dragon finishes, all those who hit him (even those who are not currently on the stream) receive credits that depend on the damage dealt (damage 1.5). 

Install all the scripts in the screenshots(for Russian, but, interface command preset is the same). You can specify pauses for strikes through the preset command. 
The creation of a dragon is recommended to be done "only for administrators". Administrators are assigned to the next tab.



Gamble Script

Chatter uses !gamble (number of coins) (red / black / zero). If the red (1-18) or black (19-38) falls, then the doubled sums of credits win. If you guess with zero - wins quadrupled credits
